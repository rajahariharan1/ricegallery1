                            which it is produced. Roughly one-half of the world population, including virtually all of
                            East and Southeast Asia, is wholly dependent upon rice as a staple food; 95 percent of the
                            world's rice crop is eaten by humans.There are more than 40,000 varieties of rice, and it is
                            a staple ingredient in more than 100 countries. Many countries have their own rice dish that
                            highlights local cuisine and culture: paella in Spain, risotto in Italy, arroz rojo in
                            Mexico, bibimbap in Korea, sushi in Japan, and so on. Rice is a mainstay for many worldwide,
                            yet popular diets like Keto, Whole 30, Paleolithic, and other low-carb plans ban this carb.
                            Is rice actually healthy, or should it be avoided?</p>

                    <p class="pb-3">White rice is refined brown rice. It has been milled and polished to remove the
                        outer brown bran layer. This process alters the flavor and texture of the rice and extends its
                        storage life.</p>
                    <p class="pb-3">Rice varieties are classified as short, medium, or long grain—this refers to the
                        length and width ratio of the rice grain when cooked. The most notable difference between
                        different grains is their starch profile.</p>

                    <p class="pb-3">Red rice is a variety of rice that is colored red by its anthocyanin content. It is
                        usually eaten unpolished or partially polished, and has a red bran layer, rather than the more
                        common pale brown. Red rice has a nutty flavor. It has the highest nutritional value[quantify]
                        among rices eaten with the bran intact.</p>
                    <p class="pb-3">Red rice contains higher antioxidant levels compared to white rice,[2] though what
                        they actually do in the human body is unclear.

                        Dehusked red rice is also a richer source of iron, magnesium, calcium and zinc than white
                        rice.[3] The same can be said of ordinary brown rice.[4]</p>

                    <p class="pb-3">Wild rice is not related to the rice family, Oryza sativa; it is a seed from an
                        aquatic grass species, genus Zizania. Despite its name, most wild rice is cultivated in farms,
                        not grown in the wild. Wild rice salad or chicken wild rice soup are a favorite ways to enjoy
                        wild rice.</p>
                    <p class="pb-3">The plants grow in shallow water in small lakes and slow-flowing streams; often,
                        only the flowering head of wild rice rises above the water. The grain is eaten by dabbling ducks
                        and other aquatic wildlife.</p>

                        sticky texture. Traditionally, Jasmine rice is steam cooked. Coconut rice is a great recipe to
                        try with Jasmine rice.</p>
                    <p class="pb-3">White rice is often preferred for taste, texture, and ease of digestion. When
                        cooked, white jasmine rice has a dry texture.[14]: 8–13  The aroma is caused by the evaporation
                        of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline.</p>

                        pilaf, biriyani, and fried rice recipes.</p>
                    <p class="pb-3">Basmati rice is believed to have been cultivated in the Indian subcontinent for
                        centuries. The earliest mention of basmati rice was made in the epic Heer Ranjha composed by the
                        Punjabi poet Waris Shah in 1766.</p>

                    <p class="pb-3">Arborio rice is an Italian short-grain rice. It is named after the town of Arborio,
                        in the Po Valley, which is situated in the region of Piedmont in Italy. When cooked, the rounded
                        grains are firm, creamy and chewy compared to other varieties of rice, due to their higher
                        amylopectin starch content.[1] It has a starchy taste and blends well with other flavours.
                        Arborio rice is often used to make risotto; other suitable varieties include Carnaroli,
                        Maratelli, Baldo, and Vialone Nano. Arborio rice is also usually used for rice pudding.</p>
                    <p class="pb-3">Arborio is a cultivar of the Japonica group of varieties of Oryza sativa.</p>

                        their natural, whole-grain form. Because brown rice still has its fibrous bran layer, it takes
                        longer to cook (and digest) and has a chewier and nuttier flavor than its refined, white rice
                        counterpart.</p>

                        brown rice is a far richer source of all nutrients when compared to unenriched white rice. Brown
                        rice is whole rice from which only the husk (the outermost layer) is removed. To produce white
                        rice, the bran layer and the germ are removed, leaving mostly the starchy endosperm. This
                        process causes the reduction or complete depletion of several vitamins and dietary minerals.
                        Missing nutrients, such as vitamins B1 and B3, and iron, are sometimes added back into the white
                        rice, a process called enrichment.</p>

                    <p>Rice is a rich source of carbohydrates, the body’s main fuel source. Carbohydrates can keep you
                        energized and satisfied, and are important for fueling exercise. Brown rice, especially, is an
                        excellent source of many nutrients, including fiber, manganese, selenium, magnesium, and B
                        vitamins. Dietary Guidelines suggest that at least half of your grains be from whole grains, and
                        brown rice is considered a whole grain. But even white rice has nutrients. It is considered a
                        good source of folate. In short, YES, rice is a healthy staple that offers many nutrients.</p>
                    <p>Should I be concerned about the arsenic in rice? Rice tends to absorb arsenic more readily than
                        other crops due to its growing environment. However, rice can be safely consumed as part of a
                        well-balanced diet. Published studies, including research by the FDA, show that cooking rice can
                        reduce up to 60 percent of the inorganic arsenic content, depending on the type of rice.</p>
                    <p>Will rice make me gain weight? While many studies have shown a connection between refined grains
                        and weight gain, research is inconsistent when it comes to white rice. It appears to be neither
                        detrimental nor favorable for weight loss. White rice—in and of itself—does not have a unique
                        ability to promote weight gain. That being said, an excess of calories from any food—rice
                        included—will lead to weight gain. Diets high in whole grains (think brown rice) have shown to
                        aid weight loss and help maintain a healthy body weight.</p>

                            <P>The rice plant can grow to over 1 m (3 ft) tall; if in deep water, it can reach a length
                                of 5 m (16 ft). A single plant may have several leafy stems or tillers. The upright stem
                                is jointed with nodes along its length; a long slender leaf arises from each node.[1]
                                The self-fertile flowers are produced in a panicle, a branched inflorescence which
                                arises from the last internode on the stem. There can be up to 350 spikelets in a
                                panicle, each containing male and female flower parts (anthers and ovule). A fertilised
                                ovule develops into the edible grain or caryopsis.</P>
                            <p>Rice is a staple food in many countries around the world for good reason. It is an
                                important and nutritious cereal crop that feeds more than half of the world’s
                                population. Rice should be an accepted and celebrated component of a balanced diet.
